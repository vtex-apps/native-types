### IOMessageWithMarkers

This component is used to render messages with interpolations and custom tags (markers). These markers are useful to wrap a part of the message with CSS handles.

| Prop name | Type | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `string` | The message that can contain values to be interpolated | `undefined` |
| `markers` | [`string`] | The list of markers to be used during interpolation | `[]` |
| `handleBase` | `string` | Handle that will be used along with the marker to create a span with `CSS handle` on the part wrapped by marks | `''` |
| `values` | `Record<string, any>` | Values used in the message interpolation | `{}` |

**Example:**
```jsx
<IOMessageWithMarkers
  message="<bold>Hello,</bold> {name}!"
  markers={['bold']}
  handleBase="Greetings"
  values={{ name: 'John Doe' }}
/>
```
 
 The following will be rendered:
``` js
  <div>
    <span
      class="Greetings_bold"
    >
      Hello,
    </span>
     John Doe!
  </div>
```


**ðŸ”´ WARNING:** The `markers` and `values` props of this component are both passed to `IOMessage` through `values` so it is important to notice that you **should not** use the same labels within these props.
